Simple review requires Python to run. All other required libraries are
included.

You can start a development web-server like this:

    ./simplereview.py [port]

The environment variable SIMPLE_REVIEW_CONFIG should point to a configuration
file. If not defined, it defaults to dev.config. You probably want to create
your own configuration and then run the server like this:

    SIMPLE_REVIEW_CONFIG=/path/to/my.config ./simplereview.py [port]

Changes are posted to the server by sending an HTTP POST request. To get
started, you can import the latest changes on the code base of simple review
(assuming you checked this out using git) by running this command:

    ./post_scripts/post_latest_from_this_repo.sh

The scripts in the post_scripts directory give you an idea how to post reviews.
You should write your own script to fit your need.
