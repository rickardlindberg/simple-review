Simple review is a web-based tool that makes it easy to comment on changes to
text files.

Changes are posted as unified diffs that are typically generated from a source
control system. The diff is displayed in a nice format and you can easily leave
comments on each line or the whole change.

See INSTALL for information how to get started using it.
