Simple review is a web-based tool that makes it easy to comment on changes to
text files.

Changes are posted as unified diffs that are typically generated from a source
control system. The diff is displayed in a nice format and you can easily leave
comments on each line or the whole change.

See INSTALL for information how to get started using it.

See CHANGES to learn what is new in this version of simple review.

See HACKING for information how to participate in the development.
